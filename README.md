# IAMFmt

üìù AWS IAM policy document formatter

## Goals 

### Data Correctness

Tooling should never change the functional effect of a policy.

### Git diff simplicity

If your project requires checking in a raw IAM policy, this tool should produce minimal diffs across commits.

### Idempotency

Running the tool multiple times should produce identical output, and running the library constituents should produce identical data structures.

### Formatting consistency

A policy should have a well-defined serialization ordering.

### Explicit over implicit

Implicit policy components should be made explicit.
